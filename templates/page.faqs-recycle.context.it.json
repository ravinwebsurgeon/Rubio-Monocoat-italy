This ensures proper disposal and helps protect the environment. Please do not throw used cloths or accessories in the regular trash, as oil-soaked materials can become flammable. To prevent this, always soak them in water before disposal."

Make sure they are completely saturated. Once soaked, you can wring them out and safely dispose of them in the regular trash."
