            "question": "How do I restore wear or colour changes of  interior wood over time?",
            "answer": "If the surface looks dry or rough but the colour is still good, you can refresh it with Universal Maintenance Oil or Refresh Eco (for furniture and worktops). If the colour has faded or the walking zone is clearly visible, reapply Oil Plus 2C in the original colour. Both types of restoration can be done without sanding."

For more stubborn stains, we offer specific solutions: Limespot Remover for limescale, Grease Remover for grease stains and Tannin Remover for black or tannin marks. If a stain has penetrated deeply into the wood, lightly sand the affected area and reapply oil locally."
