            "question": "Does applying a second coat of DuroGrit provide better protection or a deeper colour?",
            "answer": "DuroGrit is designed as a one-coat product. Applying additional coats can improve UV protection, but it also makes the system more film-forming, which may lead to issues such as peeling and longer curing times. In some cases, a second coat may be needed for aesthetic reasons, for example on heavily weathered or greyed wood. In this situation, the first coat acts as a primer and a second coat helps create a more even colour. If a second coat is applied, we recommend diluting DuroGrit with 20% water to minimise the risk of film formation."

            "question": "How can I remove overlap marks when applying DuroGrit?",
            "answer": "Small imperfections can be corrected within about 15 minutes of application, depending on the weather. While the surface is still wet, apply a small amount of DuroGrit with a brush and use light pressure to blend it into the existing layer, then smooth it out evenly. If the surface has already dried, lightly sand the overlap by hand in the direction of the wood grain and apply a small amount of fresh product. This is best done before the product has fully cured, rather than several days later."
