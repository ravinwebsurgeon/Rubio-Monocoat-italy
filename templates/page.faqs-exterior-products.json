            "question": "Does applying a second coat of DuroGrit provide better protection or a deeper colour?",
            "answer": "DuroGrit is designed as a one-coat product. Applying additional coats can improve UV protection, but it also makes the system more film-forming, which may lead to issues such as peeling and longer curing times. In some cases, a second coat may be needed for aesthetic reasons, for example on heavily weathered or greyed wood. In this situation, the first coat acts as a primer and a second coat helps create a more even colour. If a second coat is applied, we recommend diluting DuroGrit with 20% water to minimise the risk of film formation."

            "question": "How can I remove overlap marks when applying DuroGrit?",
            "answer": "Small imperfections can be corrected within about 15 minutes of application, depending on the weather. While the surface is still wet, apply a small amount of DuroGrit with a brush and use light pressure to blend it into the existing layer, then smooth it out evenly. If the surface has already dried, lightly sand the overlap by hand in the direction of the wood grain and apply a small amount of fresh product. This is best done before the product has fully cured, rather than several days later."

            "question": "What is the minimum and maximum application temperature for DuroGrit?",
            "answer": "DuroGrit should be applied at temperatures between 10 °C and 30 °C. Do not apply the product below 10 °C or above 30 °C."

            "question": "Is it really necessary to let new wood weather for 4–6 weeks before applying DuroGrit?",
            "answer": "This is a recommendation rather than a strict requirement and mainly depends on the wood species. Some woods, such as fresh Cumaru, benefit from a few weeks of weathering to allow natural extractives to wash out, as these can weaken the coating. Other species, like pine or ipé, are usually less sensitive. We recommend testing your local wood species or sending samples to our laboratory to determine whether weathering is needed in your specific case."

            "question": "What is the total drying time for DuroGrit?",
            "answer": "DuroGrit usually dries within 1 to 3 hours, depending on temperature and humidity. In many cases, you can carefully walk on the surface with socks after 1 to 2 hours. However, the product is not fully cured at this stage. On cloudy days, it may take up to 24 hours before the surface is hard enough to walk on comfortably, while sunny conditions can shorten this time."

            "question": "How do I renovate a surface with DuroGrit?",
            "answer": "Start by cleaning the surface with Exterior Wood Cleaner. Then reapply DuroGrit in the original colour, diluting it with up to 20% water depending on how much the colour has faded. This helps avoid applying too much product and keeps the colour from becoming too opaque."

            "answer": "Only use Exterior Soap (Ecospray) or All Natural Wood Cleaner (Spray) to clean surfaces treated with DuroGrit. Do not use any other cleaning products."

          "type": "faq_item",

            "question": "How do I clean brushes and tools used to apply DuroGrit?",
            "answer": "Clean brushes and tools immediately after use with water. If the bristles feel stiff or greasy after repeated use, you can also wash them with warm (not hot) water and a mild soap or washing-up liquid. Alternatively, you can use a small amount of Exterior Wood Cleaner mixed with water, as this helps the product loosen more easily. Rinse thoroughly with clean water until the water runs clear."

            "question": "Can DuroGrit colours be mixed?",
            "answer": "In theory, DuroGrit colours can be mixed. However, these custom mixes may not offer the same level of long-lasting protection as our standard colours and may fade more quickly. As these combinations have not been tested in our laboratory, we cannot guarantee their durability."
